Image-Morpher

Project for CIS 581: Computer Vision at University of Pennsylvania

You can use Image-Morpher to create a gif morphing your face into Ryan Gosling, or anybody else as you wish!

Steps:
  1. Go to morph_tri.py
  2. At variables im1 and im2, swap out the current image names with your own images (Make sure you provide their file paths).
  3. The im1_pts and im2_pts are the correspondence points between the two images. You can hardcode the points of your pictures, or comment the default ones out and use the click_correspondences function to get the correspondence points through mouse click. 
  4. Run morph_tri.py and check your folder for the gif of your face morphing into someone else's!
